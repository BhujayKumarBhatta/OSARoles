    """Notes about this strategy.

    When this strategy encounters a task with a "when" or "register" stanza it
    will collect results immediately essentially forming a block. If the task
    does not have a "when" or "register" stanza the results will be collected
    after all tasks have been queued.

    To improve execution speed if a task has a "when" conditional attached to
    it the conditional will be rendered before queuing the task and should the
    conditional evaluate to True the task will be queued. To ensure the correct
    execution of playbooks this optimisation will only be used if there are no
    lookups used with the task which is to guarantee proper task execution.

    To optimize transport reliability if a task is using a "delegate_to" stanza
    the connection method will change to paramiko if the connection option has
    been set at "smart", the Ansible 2.x default. Regardless of the connection
    method if a "delegate_to" is used the task will have pipelining disabled
    for the duration of that specific task.

    Container context will be added to the ``playbook_context`` which is used
    to further optimise connectivity by only ever SSH'ing into a given host
    machine instead of attempting an SSH connection into a container.
