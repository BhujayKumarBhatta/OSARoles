The audit rules which monitor ``chmod``, ``fchmod``, and ``fchmodat``
syscalls can cause high CPU and I/O load during OpenStack-Ansible deployments
and while updating packages with apt. By default, these rules are disabled.

These audit rules can be enabled by setting any of the following variables:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_audit_DAC_chmod: yes
    security_audit_DAC_fchmod: yes
    security_audit_DAC_fchmodat: yes
