The STIG requires IPv6 to be disabled system-wide unless it is needed for the
system to operate. Deployers must consider how their network is configured
before disabling IPv6 entirely.

To opt-in for this change, set the following Ansible variable to ``yes``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_ipv6: yes

**NOTE:** This change will go into effect **immediately** on the system and
persist through reboots.
