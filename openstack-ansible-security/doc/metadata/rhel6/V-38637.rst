The auditd package is verified with ``debsums`` in Ubuntu and with ``rpm`` in
CentOS. The playbook will fail immediately if any of the files from the auditd
package have been altered. This could be the sign of a system compromise.

.. note::

    If the ``debsums`` package isn't installed on Ubuntu, the Ansible task will
    install it during the playbook run.
