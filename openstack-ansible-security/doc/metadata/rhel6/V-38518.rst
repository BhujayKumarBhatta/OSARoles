Different systems may have different log files populated depending on the type
of data that ``rsyslogd`` receives. By default, log files are created with the
user and group ownership set to root.

Deployers should review the files generated by the ``rsyslogd`` daemon to
verify that they have the most restrictive ownership and permissions.
