The audit rules for permission changes made with ``chown`` are disabled by
default as they can generate an excessive amount of logs in a short period of
time, especially during a deployment.

Deployers can enable auditing for ``chown`` usage by setting the following
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security_audit_DAC_chown: yes
