The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) must be disabled if it's not
needed. Although this protocol is occasionally used in some OpenStack
environments for quality of service functions, it is not in the default
implementation.

To opt-out of this change, simply change the following variable to ``no``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_module_dccp: no

**NOTE:** The module will be disabled on the next reboot.
