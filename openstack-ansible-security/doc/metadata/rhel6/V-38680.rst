The Ansible tasks will ensure that mail for the ``auditd`` user is forwarded
to the ``root`` user for review.

Deployers are strongly urged to review V-38446 to ensure they have set the
``security_root_forward_email`` variable so that the email system can route
these critical notifications to a monitored mailbox.
