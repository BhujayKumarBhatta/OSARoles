**Fixed by another STIG**

The Ansible tasks for V-38620 will configure the ``chrony`` daemon and allow
deployers to specify their NTP servers. Deployers that are subject to US DoD
requirements will need to use DoD-approved time servers. Refer to the STIG in
the STIG viewer using the link above this "Developer Notes" section.
