Although the STIG recommends disabling root logins via ssh, the default in
this role is to allow it. The openstack-ansible deployment uses the root
user by default at this time, but that may change later and allow for this
configuration to be set.

To disallow root logins via ssh, simply adjust this configuration variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_ssh_permit_root_login: 'no'

**NOTE:** The quotes around ``'no'`` or ``'yes'`` are very important. Ansible
will treat ``no`` and ``yes`` as booleans by default and that will cause a
``True`` to land in your sshd configuration file. This will causes errors
during sshd's startup.
