Ubuntu 14.04 sets the ownership on ``/boot/grub/grub.cfg`` to root by default.
The Ansible task will ensure that the secure default is maintained.

In Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7, the bootloader configuration files in
``/boot/grub2`` are owned by the root user by default.

Deployers should monitor these files for changes in ownership, permissions and
contents. The ``aide`` daemon is installed by the security role to monitor
these files.
