The STIG makes several requirements for IPv4 network restrictions, but these
restrictions can impact certain network interfaces and cause service
disruptions. Some security configurations make sense for certain types of
network interfaces, like bridges, but other restrictions cause the network
interface to stop passing valid traffic between hosts, containers, or virtual
machines.

The default network scripts and LXC userspace tools already configure various
network devices to their most secure setting. Since some hosts will act as
routers, enabling security configurations that restrict network traffic can
cause service disruptions for OpenStack environments.
