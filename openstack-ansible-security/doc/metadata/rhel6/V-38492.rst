Virtual consoles are helpful during an emergency and they can only be reached
by physical or other out-of-band access (such as DRAC, iLO, or iKVM). This
change can be confusing for system administrators and it is left up to the
deployer to complete.

As an alternative, deployers could take action to restrict physical access to
server terminals. Out-of-band access mechanisms should be segmented onto their
own restricted network and should use centralized authentication.
