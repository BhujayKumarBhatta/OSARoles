Accepting ICMP redirects has few legitimate uses. It should be disabled unless
it is absolutely required.

It is configurable by ``security_disable_icmpv6_redirects`` variable. This
feature is disabled by default. Disabling IPv6 redirects can cause issues with
OpenStack environments which have IPv6 enabled and are routing IPv6 traffic.

Deployers can opt-in to this change and disable ICMPv6 redirects by setting
the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security_disable_icmpv6_redirects: yes
