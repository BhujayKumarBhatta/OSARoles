The mode on rsyslog files is set to ``0640`` by default in Ubuntu 14.04 and
Ubuntu 16.04 by default. CentOS 7 sets the mode to ``0600`` by default. The
Ansible tasks will adjust the rsyslog configuration so that any new log files
will have the mode set to ``0600``.

This will take effect the next time that log files are rotated with
``logrotate`` (configured in V-38624). Deployers can also make this change
manually with ``chmod``.
