Creating encrypted storage is left up to the deployer to consider and
implement. Although encrypting data at rest on storage volumes does reduce
the chances of data theft if the server is physically compromised, it doesn't
provide protection from a user who is logged in while the server is running.

Linux systems provide various options for storage encryption. The `Linux
Unified Key Setup`_ is a good implementation to review.
