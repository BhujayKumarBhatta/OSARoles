In Ubuntu 14.04, the upstart init system looks for the default runlevel in the
``/etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf`` file. The tasks in the security role will ensure
that the ``DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL`` environment variable is set to ``2``, which is a
non-graphical runlevel.

In Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7, systemd handles various targets, which are
similar to runlevels from earlier init systems. There are two targets that are
important for this STIG:

* ``graphical.target``: similar to runlevel 5 from earlier init systems
* ``multi-user.target``: similar to runlevel 2 or 3 from earlier init systems

The tasks in the security role will ensure that the default target is the
``multi-user.target``, which provides a text-based system.

Deployers can opt out of this change by setting an Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_x_windows: no

.. note::

    This change will not take effect until the server is rebooted. Changing a
    runlevel on an actively running system can cause certain services to stop,
    start, or restart.
