The STIG requires that all martian packets are logged by setting the sysctl
parameter ``net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians`` to ``1``.

Although the logs can be valuable in some situations, the setting can generate
a *significant* amount of logging in OpenStack environments, especially those
that use neutron's Linux bridge networking. In some situations, the logging can
flood the physical terminal and make troubleshooting at the console or via out
of band (like iKVM, DRAC and iLO) **extremely difficult**.

The role will ensure that martian packet logging is disabled by default.
Deployers that need this logging enabled will need to set the following
Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security_sysctl_enable_martian_logging: yes

Wikpedia's article on `martian packets`_ provides additional information.
