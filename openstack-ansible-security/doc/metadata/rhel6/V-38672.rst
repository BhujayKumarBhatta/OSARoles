Ubuntu doesn't provide the ``netconsole`` package and the daemon isn't included
in any other Ubuntu packages.

In CentOS, the ``netconsole`` daemon will be stopped and disabled if it is
found to be installed. Deployers can opt-out of this change by setting the
following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_netconsole: no
