At the moment, openstack-ansible already sends logs to the rsyslog container
from various containers and hosts. However, deployers are strongly urged
to forward these logs to a system outside their openstack-ansible environment
to ensure that they cannot be altered.

Some compliance programs require centralized logging, including PCI-DSS.
