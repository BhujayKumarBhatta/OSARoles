The STIG requires administrators to search for directories meeting all of the
following criteria:

* World writable
* Owned by a normal user (UID > 499)

It requires that those directories are owned by root to prevent users from
removing and replacing files. This ``find`` command isn't run within the
Ansible tasks in openstack-ansible-security because it can be a very
time-consuming task and it can slow down disk I/O while it runs.

Deployers are strongly urged to review the permissions and ownerships of
critical directories on their systems regularly to verify that they meet
the requirements of this STIG.
