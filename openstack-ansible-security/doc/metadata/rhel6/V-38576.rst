The STIG requires SHA512 to be used for hashing password since it is
in the list of FIPS 140-2 approved hashing algorithms. This is also the
default in Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, and CentOS 7.

The Ansible tasks will verify that the secure default is still set in
``/etc/login.defs``. If it has been altered, the playbook will fail
and display an error.
