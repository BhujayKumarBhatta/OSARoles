The security role verifies that the GPG keys that correspond to each supported
Linux distribution are installed on each host. If the GPG keys are not found,
or if they differ from the list of trusted GPG keys, the playbook execution
will stop.

Deployers can skip this task (and avoid this failure) by using ``--skip-tags
V-38476`` when they are applying the security role.
