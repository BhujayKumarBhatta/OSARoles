The STIG requires that secure ICMP redirects are disabled, but this can cause
issues in some virtualized or containerized environments. The Ansible tasks
in the security role will not disable these redirects by default.

Deployers who want to enable the task (and disable ICMP redirects), should set
the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security_disable_icmpv4_redirects_secure: yes
