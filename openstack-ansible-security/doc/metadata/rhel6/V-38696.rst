The AIDE package is already installed as part of the Ansible tasks to fix
V-38429, but these Ansible tasks will verify that the cron job file is actually
in place. The cron job is installed as part of the aide package installation.
If the cron job is missing, an error will be printed and the playbook will
fail.
