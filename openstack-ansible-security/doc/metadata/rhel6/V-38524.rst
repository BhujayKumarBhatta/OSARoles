The STIG requires that ICMPv4 redirects are disabled on the host. However, this
can cause problems with LXC-based deployments, such as environments deployed
with OpenStack-Ansible.

Deployers can opt-in for this change by setting the following Ansible variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

   security_disable_icmpv4_redirects: yes
