Although some OpenStack implementations use ``qpidd`` for their messaging hub,
neither Ubuntu or openstack-ansible configures the service on the hosts by
default. The Ansible task for this STIG will check to see if the init script
exists for ``qpidd``. If it does, the daemon will be stopped and disable on
the next boot.

To opt-out of this change, adjust the following Ansible variable to ``no``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    security_disable_qpidd: no
