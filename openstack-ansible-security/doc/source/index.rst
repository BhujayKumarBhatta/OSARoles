OpenStack-Ansible: Host security hardening
==========================================

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The openstack-ansible-security role provides security hardening for
`OpenStack`_ environments deployed with `openstack-ansible`_.  The role has
multiple goals:

* Provide additional security in a highly configurable, integrated way without
  disrupting a production OpenStack environment.
* Make it easier for organizations to meet the requirements of compliance
  programs, such as `Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)`_.
* Document all changes to allow deployers to make educated decisions on which
  security configuration changes to apply.

At this time, the role follows the requirements of the US Government's
`Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)`_ for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6.

The easiest method for reviewing the STIG configurations and the relevant
metadata is through the `STIG Viewer`_ service provided by `UCF`_.
